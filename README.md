# Spectral Clustering

Project for CSCI 4971 Large Scale Matrix Computation and Machine Learning exploring spectral
clustering algorithms are very large data sets. Specifically, I examine the algorithm presented in
"Time and Space Efficient Spectral Clustering via Column Sampling" by Li *et al.*
